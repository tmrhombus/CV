\section{Academic/Employment History}

I am currently in the second half of writing a book relating to particle physics and the discovery of the Higgs boson with over 400 pages completed in draft form. Previously, I was at the Santa Fe Preparatory School, teaching and developing a curriculum for Calculus and Algebra II. Prior to that, I was a carpenter at South Shore Boatworks under the supervision of my uncle Bob Fuller, a third generation master craftsman and owner of the last shop in the USA still producing all-wood traditional ship wheels. In addition to wheels, I worked on custom marine joinery from the finishing of interiors for larger ships to complete builds of smaller craft under power or sail as well as developing a system for incorporating modern CNC routers into the traditional hand system.

\vspace{5pt}

Before coming to South Shore Boatworks, I was based at the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) for nearly six years, where I earned my PhD in particle physics and worked as a postdoctoral research fellow for two years. During the first year of my postdoc I was selected to skip the first tier of management and became directly the Operations Manager for the Hadronic Calorimeter (HCAL), one of four subsystems comprising the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) experiment. In this role, I was responsible for overseeing the testing, installation, and commissioning of new readout electronics on both endcaps of CMS, chairing weekly meetings discussing the status and plans for the HCAL, leading training sessions on operations/data taking/technical debugging, reporting to upper management on behalf of the HCAL, and carrying a CERN phone at all times so as to be able to respond to interruptions in data taking at any time. 

\vspace{5pt}

As a postdoc I also supervised graduate students on a new physics analysis searching for long-lived scalar particles arising as the product of Higgs boson decays using the associated production of a vector boson to identify candidate events. We used central CMS software based in \texttt{c++/ROOT/python} for initial object reconstruction and I wrote a framework from scratch using these languages to do the selections/analysis/plotting which was later more generally adopted by others and is still in use today.

\vspace{5pt}

I came to the University of Wisconsin - Madison as a graduate student in the summer of 2011 after graduating in 2009 from Union College and spending a year in rural Uganda on a social entrepreneurship fellowship and another working as a technician for a chemical engineer at the USA site of General Electric's Global Research Center. Before starting my graduate school course work, I was with IceCube for a summer and began research with the CMS collaboration under Wesley Smith in the beginning of 2012, coming out to CERN for the first time that summer and taking shifts monitoring the data taking for the end of Run 1. After finishing my second year back in Madison, I moved to CERN full-time in May 2013 and contributed studies which were used in the Technical Design Report for a new trigger system as well as working on the 7 TeV W+bb physics analysis.

During my time as a graduate student, I continued on to become the editor for the 8 TeV W+bb analysis and was selected as the point of contact between the Standard Model Physics analysis groups and the b-tagging group. As the LHC was preparing to turn back on in 2015, I regularly took shifts in the CMS control room, and often worked underground and in the lab testing/preparing/installing hardware for the upgraded trigger system. As the 8 TeV W+bb paper began nearing completion, I joined and the monophoton analysis and contributed studies for a year before the paper went public. Unfortunately, we did not find dark matter.
