I was formally trained at the world's leading particle physics laboratory (CERN) to collect, clean, analyze, and present data on the petabyte scale. As a graduate student and postdoc there, I worked primarily in \texttt{c++} and \texttt{Python} in \texttt{Linux}-based environments to lead analyses and datataking operations. Recently I have been teaching and writing,  and am ready to bring my technical skills to industry.

\section{Relevant Experience}
 {\large {\bf Graduate Research Assistant} 2012-2016, University of Wisconsin and CERN} \\
  Collected and analyzed data from the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC), specializing in dark matter searches and heavy-flavor physics with displaced secondary vertices  \\ % , as well as monitoring and control of network-connected high-speed data acquisition and cleaning hardware  \\
 - contributed to the collection and analysis of the largest physics dataset in history \\
 - wrote software for efficient cleaning, data-driven analysis, statistical modeling, interpretation, and visualization of petabyte-scale datasets, including machine learning techniques (neural net and BDT) \\
 - ran analysis software on a distributed computing network using HTCondor, stored in HDFS filesystems \\
 - took shifts in the control room and served as on-call expert monitoring data-taking, diagnosing problems, and delivering solutions in a fast-paced, high-pressure environment  \\
 - served as editor for one published paper, contributed to eight others 

 {\large {\bf Postdoctoral Research Fellow} 2016-2018, Florida State University and CERN}  \\
 Lead analyses using the Higgs boson to search for evidence of new physics and was appointed to HCAL Operations Manager, overseeing all aspects of data collection for one of only four CMS subdetectors. \\ % systems on the CMS detector.  \\
{\bf - wrote custom codebase for physics analysis in {\texttt c++} that is still in use 5 years later} \\
- trained and supervised subdetector experts who monitored datataking in real time, chaired weekly meetings of \~30 physicists, carried a CERN phone 24/7 for emergency response \\
- had the authority to speak on behalf of a subdetector in a 3500+ person international collaboration

 {\large {\bf Math Teacher/Tutor} 2019-present, Santa Fe Preparatory School} \\
 Taught algebra and calculus, as well as tutoring privately \\
- improved presentation skills, organization, and communication with nonexperts 

\section{Skills}
